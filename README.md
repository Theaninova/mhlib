# MHLIB

![](godot/icon.png)

A project to make the old classic Moorhuhn Games playable
on modern systems via an engine reimplementation, written
in Rust and Godot.

Most of the Moorhuhn Games are structured quite similarly,
which makes supporting them relatively easy.

## Supported Games

Support of games primarily depends on who developed them - Games with structurally similar data are easier to support than games who use a different engine.
